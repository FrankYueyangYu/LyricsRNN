  "plain": "Ed Sheeran is a singer/songwriter who was born in Halifax, England but was raised in Suffolk, England. He\u2019s known for his energetic live shows, which involve him using a loop pedal and sometimes throwing some raps in for good measure.\n\nEd\u2019s success story began with him playing music in older people\u2019s homes. He first was picked up by a record producer when busking in the USA. He performed nearly a thousand gigs and street performances before getting the recognition he deserved. Unsigned projects such as Loose Change and Songs I Wrote with Amy relied on the production of long-term collaborator Jake Gosling and signaled the start of their hugely successful musical relationship. Soon he\u2019d made countless industry friends.\n\nTeaming up with some of the biggest names in UK grime \u2013 Wiley, Ghetts, Jme and more \u2013 he released the No. 5 Collaborations Project in January 2011, and it reached number 46 on the UK Singles Chart. One of the songs, \u201cLittle Lady\u201d (feat. Mikill Pane), was a fan favourite, so Ed made a more radio-friendly solo version entitled \u201cThe A Team\u201d and the rest is history. The song now has over a million sales in the UK and two million in the US.\n\nPicked up by Asylum/Atlantic Records, Sheeran released another single entitled \u201cYou Need Me, I Don\u2019t Need You.\u201d He released his debut album + in September 2011, to great critical acclaim. It topped the UK Albums Chart and has sold nearly two million copies in the UK alone.\n\nMany successful singles, features, and an EP with Yelawolf later, Ed scored his first UK #1 with the Pharrell Williams-produced \u201cSing\u201d. Then came his 7x Platinum sophomore album x, which features a slew of hugely successful singles including \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d, \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d and \u201cBloodstream\u201d.\n\nAfter an entire year of social media silence, Sheeran announced his comeback on New Year\u2019s Day 2017. His third album, \u00f7, was released in March and included the hit singles \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d and \u201cShape of You\u201d.\n\nEd Sheeran was the most streamed artist on Spotify in 2017 with 47 million monthly listeners. His album, \u00f7, was the most streamed album in the world with 3,1 billion streams and the song \u201cShape of You\u201d is the most streamed song ever with more than 1,4 billion streams.\n\nSheeran largely spent 2018 and the first half of 2019 on tour, but he also found time to work on his next album. It was released in July of 2019 and was titled No.6 Collaborations Project."

(What's your history?)\nDo you have a tendency to lead some people on?\n'Cause I heard you do, mmm\nI could fall, or I could fly\nHere in your aeroplane\nAnd I could live, I could die\nHanging on the words you say\nAnd I've been known to give my all\nAnd lie awake, every day\nDon't know how much I can take\n\nSo don't call me baby\nUnless you mean it\nDon't tell me you need me\nIf you don't believe it\nSo let me know the truth\nBefore I dive right into you\n\n\nI could fall, or I could fly\nHere in your aeroplane\nAnd I could live, I could die\nHanging on the words you say\nAnd I've been known to give my all\nSitting back, looking at\nEvery mess that I made\nSo don't call me baby\nUnless you mean it\nDon't tell me you need me\nIf you don't believe it\nLet me know the truth\nBefore I dive right into you\nBefore I dive right into you\nBefore I dive right into you59EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind\nLearned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the world's against me is when I really come alive\nAnd every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\nYou know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs\nI think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun\nI need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become\nGuess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me\nWithout a nine-to-five job or a uni degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nShow me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key\nAnd you'll see\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more\n\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\nI chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell\nRelationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run\nI beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become\nConversations with my father on the A14\nAge 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams\nNow I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me\nWith my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'\nI may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration's allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now\nSomehow\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more\n\nAnother one to take the sting away\nOh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nWelcome to the new show\nI guess you know I've been away\nBut where I'm heading, who knows?\nBut my heart will stay the same\nWelcome to the new show\nI guess you know I've been away\nBut where I'm heading, who knows?\nMy pain eraser\n\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser27EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Oh-oh, ooh-ooh\nOh-oh, ooh-ooh\nSING!\nIf you love me\nCome on, get involved\nFeel it rushin' through you\nFrom your head to toe\nLOUDER!

'Cause you always do what's right\n\nCan we just talk a while until my worries disappear?\nI'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure\nYou'd say, \"Remember that the answer's in the love that we create\"\nSo much has changed since you've been away\n\nI wish that Heaven had visiting hours\nAnd I would ask them if I could take you home\nBut I know what they'd say, that it's for the best\nSo I will live life the way you taught me\nAnd make it on my own\nAnd I will close the door, but I will open up my heart\nAnd everyone I love will know exactly who you are\n'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again\nSo much has changed since you've been away9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow\nI've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know\nYou'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in\nI never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden\nWatch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision\nSigned to a label but didn't listen to any criticism\nThought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen\nStudio is a system and you could say that I'm driven\nAnd now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager\nI'll never try to win you over like your stepfather\nI'll do my own thing now and get respect after\nAnd I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter\nFor four years I never had a place to stay\nBut it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight\nAt 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home\nI was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked\nAnd went from sleeping at a subway station\nTo sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population\nNot my imagination, I don't wanna relax\nWould it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now\n\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\nI take it back with the rhythm and blues\nWith my rap pack, I'll be singing the news\nTryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school\nI'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes\nI'll give you the truth through the vocal booth\nAnd stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit\nThey try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot\nBut then again that's what they're supposed to do\nAnd I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm\nWhispering, \"Everything that happens is from now on\"\nI'll be ready to start again by the end of the song\nAnd still they're claiming that I handle it wrong\nBut then I've never had an enemy except the NME\nBut I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees\nAre healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree\nSinging for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids\nI keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic\nI'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it\nThis song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now\n\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo, I'll take it back now\nNow, I don't ever wanna be perfect\n'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\nAnd I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed\nTaking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus\nPutting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\nConsidering a name change, thinking it was hopeless\nRhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition\n'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written\nNow absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking Absinthe can change your mind state\nVividly, need to let my liver be\nAnd I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends\nIt's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\n'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally\nIt might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but\nBut I just write schemes\nI'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely\nYou'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates\nHaving a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made\nAnd every single second knowing that we'll never betray\nThe way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down\nThat's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love\nNo\n\nMy dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme\nTill I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?\nWith this you must know that the numbers just sold\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\nWe forget 90 percent of it when we wake\nBut the other 10 percent, it never fades\nDreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads\nTried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade\nOh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more\nA couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought\nYou'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors\nNow I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour\nWriting love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit\nYou can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\nI'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss\nAnd most of these other guys are kids that pose\nHis little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is\nDreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it\nTread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower\nYou'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow\nIgh!58EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well\nAnd I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell\nSometimes I wonder, in any other summer\nCould you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?\nUnder the covers where we used to lay\nAnd RE: Stacks is what the speakers played\nI'd be on tour almost every day\nWhen I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay\nJust watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed\nGetting high as two kites when we needed to breathe\nWe used each other's air just for the people to see\nAnd stay up all night like when we needed to sleep\nWe go anywhere, our minds would take us\nAnd I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up\nAnd you don\u2019t even need to worry about your weight cause\nWe can all be loved the way that God made us\nAnd time's the only reason that we could break up\nCause you would always tell me I'm away too much\nDistance is relative to the time that it takes\nTo get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again\n\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\nCause I ain't never coming home, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now?\nAnd I've been living on the road, Nina\nBut then again you should know, Nina\nCause that\u2019s you and me both, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?\nAnd every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie\nWith drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold\nTaking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own\nCause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone\nWatching Blue Planet, creating new habits\nActing as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish\nBack to the burrow with all the Celtics\nI disappear, you call me selfish\nI understand but I can\u2019t help it\nI put my job over everything except my family and friends\nBut you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back\nOverlook the situation\nCause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications\nAnd I'm not saying we should be taking a break\nJust re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it\u2019s too late\nSo we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane\nBut in a day we'll have to say it again\n\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\nCause I ain't never coming home, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now?\nAnd I've been living on the road, Nina\nBut then again you should know, Nina\nCause that\u2019s you and me both, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?\nLove will come and love will go\nBut you can't make it on your own\nSing that song, go\nOh won't you leave me now?\nPeople grow and fall apart\nBut you can't mend your broken heart\nTake it back, go\nOh won't you leave me now?\n\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\n(Love will come and Love will go)\nCause I ain't never coming home, Nina\n(But you can make it on your own)\nOh, won't you leave me now?\n(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)\nAnd I've been living on the road, Nina\n(People grow and fall apart)\nBut then again you should know, Nina\n(But you can mend your broken heart)\nCause that\u2019s you and me both, Nina\n(Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?\nOh Nina\nYou should go, Nina\n(Love will come and Love will go)\nCause I ain't never coming home, Nina\n(But you can make it on your own)\nOh, won't you leave me now?\n(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)\nAnd I've been living on the road, Nina\n(People grow and fall apart)\nBut then again you should know, Nina\n(But you can mend your broken heart)\nCause that\u2019s you and me both, Nina\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?\n44EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Keep it between friends?\nThough I know you'll never love me, like you used to\nThere may be other people like us\nWill see the flicker of the clipper when they light up\nFlames just create us, burns don't heal like before\nYou don't hold me anymore\n\nOn cold days, cold plays out like the band's name\nI know I can't heal things with a handshake\nYou know I can't change, as I began saying\nYou cut me wide open like a landscape\nOpen bottles of beer but never champagne\nTo applaud you with the sound that my hands make\nShould I? Should I?\n\nMaybe I'll get drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nTo feel a little love\nAll by myself\nI'm here again\nAll by myself\nYou know I'll never change\nAll by myself\nAll by myself\n\nI'm just drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nTo feel a little love36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "Listen, little lady\nThis is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday\nYou work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes\nLady, the word \"rape\" sums up events that take place every night\nYou wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try\nAnd you remember that your punter went crazy last night\nYou drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry\nForget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for\nYou'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw\nThey'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure\nThey'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door\nBut young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker\nMedical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't\nEver let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him\nCause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in\n\nShe's just under the upper hand\nAnd goes mad for a couple grams\nAnd she don't wanna go outside, tonight\n'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland\nAnd sell love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nFor angels to fly\nLittle lady, your mind you've made up\nYour injuries you can't hide with make-up\nYou need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just\nIn case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb\nWith any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip\nLast year when your pimp just lost it\nHe wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway\n'Cause all the heroin is making you age\nBut you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag\nThe funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram\nMother had to get you out the motherland to study\nThat was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand\nLittle does she know you're never coming back\nShe put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan\nHe's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer\nFancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn\n\nShe's just under the upper hand\nAnd goes mad for a couple grams\nAnd she don't wanna go outside, tonight\n'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland\nAnd sell love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nNow an angel will die, covered in white\nWith closed eyes and hoping for a better life\nThis time now, we'll fade out tonight\nStraight down the line\n\nLittle lady, you're trembling with fear\nYour skinny frame kinda resembles a deer\nYou're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear\nThe meddling nurse couldn't just leave it\nShe's only gone and made it much worse calling police in\nShe'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused\nYou're causing scandal going mad in the ward now\nThe cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you\nThe same question he keeps trying to ask you, \"Who you working for?\"\nHe's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore\nYou're having a conversation you could be murdered for\nYou're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court\nHe's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before\nJust before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard\nHe underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card\nBegs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid\n'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own\nYou've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe\nYou reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home\nBefore you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat\nAnd then a voice says, \"Where you been, bitch? I wanna know\"\nNo prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness\nYou open the front door, he boots you in\nThere's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror\nGet your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error\nHe towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight\nAt this point, your life flashes before your eyes\nYour handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor\nDespite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye\nAnd in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece\nAnd dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street\nLittle lady left this earth in the worst way\nAll because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday\nAnd we're all under the upper hand\nAnd going mad for a couple grams\nAnd we don't wanna go outside, tonight\n'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland\nAnd sell love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nFor angels to fly\nAnd fly, fly\nFor angels to fly\nTo fly, to fly\nAnd angels to die17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind\nLearned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the world's against me is when I really come alive\nAnd every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\nYou know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs\nI think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become\nI guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me\nWithout a nine-to-five job or a uni degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nThey showed me the locked doors I find another use of key\nAnd you'll see\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\nI chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run\nI beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\nAge twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams\nNow I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me\nWith my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou\nI may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration's allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now\nSomehow\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nI woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror\nThinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner\nThe industry told me to look like them\nBut I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner\nI wish that she could have been my first time\nAnd I wish that I'd never took that first line\nAnd I wish that every word in this verse rhymed\nBut forgive me if it doesn't\nI wish that I could make peace with my older cousin\nI wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't\nI wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'\nAnd the taste stays underneath my tongue, and\nWish that I had known what to do as a youngen\nWish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party\nWith that hardly matters now, man, does it?\nWish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it\nI wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget\nBut while we're on the subject\nI wish my private life would have never gone public\nBut that's the sacrifice that we make\nSpendin' my whole time high livin' life away\n\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI wish my family and friends, they stay healthy\nI wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy\nI found myself late night wishin' on a star\nEveryday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh\nAnd I wish I'd never run through\nEvery woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to\nI wish I was the role model you looked up to\nIf I told my fans the things I did they'd say, \"Fuck you\"\nI wish I was home more\nI wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour\nAnd I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more\nPeople that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for\nAnd I wish he never got cancer\nAnd if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?\nOh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause\nEvery day this cocaine gets the best of us\nUsin' my balance on razor blades\nSpendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait\n\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\n\nI'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat\nMum sayin', \"Don't smoke,\" no, I don't listen, I got\nLove for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast\nPeople that I don't know share the same vision\nI find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine\nTryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign\nSometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme\nStarin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine\nShit quick before I hit it again\nSurrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men\nAnd who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen\nJust let me hit the studio when we can rip it again\nI'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick\nMy daddy told me, \"Work hard and you can never be shit\"\nI've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad\nSet back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had\nOne wish9EmbedShare

   "lyrics": "Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson\nFace hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance\nHey, did I mention as she makes an entrance?\nSaid I had a tendency to finish off a sentence\nOh well, she\u2019s a local girl\nNo make-up cause she knows me well\nHair tied up in elastic band\nWith a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man\nIt's like the fast food, I\u2019ll regret it after\nAnd I needed money but I\u2019m too shy to ask her\nSo she buys me chips and cheese\nAnd I tell her that I love her and she\u2019s all I need\nI take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley\nShe\u2019s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi\nHeading to the party, sitting in the car seat\nB.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly\nShe knows me well\nBit of a catch to have a local girl\nHair tied up in elastic band\nWith a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man\n\nI don\u2019t wanna go alone\nI don\u2019t wanna go alone\nNo, I don't wanna go alone\nTell her that I love her, tell her that I need her\nTell her that she\u2019s more than a one-night stand\nTell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair\nAll I wanna do is be near\nTell her that I want her, tell her that I need her\nTell her that she\u2019s more than a one-night stand\nTell her that I love her more than anyone else\nIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll tell her myself\n\nAnd we\u2019ve got that love in us and we're the drink killers\nWe\u2019re gonna dance all night to the floor fillers\nIf we talk outside, say \"Hey what's new?\"\nI don\u2019t really dance so I\u2019ll just watch you\nAre you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that\u2019s alright\nI don\u2019t wanna be here, I\u2019m not the sofa type\nTell me if you have a toothbrush you don\u2019t mind sharing\nShe said I wanna take off what you\u2019re wearing\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s like the fast food, I\u2019ll regret it after\nAnd I needed money but I\u2019m too shy to ask her\nBut she buys me chips and cheese\nSo I tell her that she\u2019s all I need\nTell her that I, tell her that I\nTell her that she\u2019s more than a one-night stand\nTell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair\nAll I wanna do is be near\nTell her that I, tell her that I\nTell her that she\u2019s more than a one-night stand\nTell her that I love her more than anyone else\nIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll tell her myself\n11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be\nAwaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees\nAdmiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe\nJet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep\nAlthough my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any\nClock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many\nAlthough my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon\nCause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true\nWe make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths\nTo see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves\nI say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme\nSo I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine\nCause real recognise real is what my father says\nAnd I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away\nOverworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow\nBut I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close\n\n5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire\nSleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require\nI swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead\nWho's on the beat upon the feature with Ed?\nIt's D-E-V to the Zed\nOver tired, pale faced like Michael Myers\nBags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired\nAnd over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll\nNever find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying\nCause I got too much to stay awake for\nTo sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war\nScissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives\nTwo psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight\nI'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line\nVillans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes\nBe wide awake just like you're snorting lines\nOr get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times I'm living in\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times I'm living in lately\n\nI brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth\nAnd the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out\nDeliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those\nThat hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy\nBelieve me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be\nOn minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in\nIt's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with\nThen my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in\nI try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows\nSome of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone\nI'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro\nLiving out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow\nOpposite of sober cause I never did my homework\nWhich has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older\nI played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie\nI wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die)\nTwo guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge\nMaking metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes\nAnd if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze\nTimes elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move\nWe scan the situation, analyse information\nAnd then decide what probably is most practical to do\nDriven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets\nAt all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true\nI'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em\nWe got the fans all like, \"Oh wow it's Devs and Ed\"\nWhat less did you bloody expect from 'em?\"\nIn the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment\nFighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock\nAnd no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got\nI keep my pupils engaged\nLike a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake\n\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times I'm living in\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times I'm living in lately\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times I'm living in\nI never sleep\nWhen trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free\nIt could be\nThe times I'm living in lately3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
