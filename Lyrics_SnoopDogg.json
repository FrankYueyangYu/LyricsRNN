You hoochie groupie\nI have no love for hoes\nThat's something that I learned in Tha Pound\nSo how the fuck am I supposed to pay this hoe just to lay this hoe?\nI know the pussy's mines, so I'mma fuck a couple mo' times\nAnd then I'm through with it, there's nothin' else to do with it\nPass it to the homie, now you hit it\n'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me\nAnd y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me\nI gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?\nApproach her with a different proposition\nI'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one, trick-ass bitch!\n\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\n\nGuess who's back in the motherfuckin' house?\nWith a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth\nHoes recognize, niggas do too\n'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo\nWhat you gon' do? You really don't know\nSo I'd advise you not to trust that ho\nSilly of me to fall in love with a bitch\nKnowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip\nNow, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger\nHow many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop?\nDoggy, I'm all the above\nI'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes\nBut see, it ain't no fun\nIf my homies can't get a taste of it\n'Cause you know I don't love 'em\nWoo! Hey, now you know\nInhale, exhale with my flow\nOne for the money, two for the bitches\nThree to get ready, and four to hit the switches\nIn my Chevy, '64\u2014red, to be exact\nWith bitches on my side and bitches on my back\nSo back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'\nJust get on your knees and then start jugglin'\nThese motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth\nIt's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout\n\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none46EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

That's why we never have no beef\nSo I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf\nUsed Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale\nAnd then I got the file for my fingernails\nI'm true to the style on my behalf\nI put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath\nClean, dry, was my body and hair\nI threw on my brand new doggy underwear\nFor all the bitches I might take home\nI got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne\nNow I'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks\nThrew on my white socks, with my all-blue Chucks\nStepped out the house, stopped short, \"oh no\"\nI went back in, \"I forgot my Indo!\"\nThen I dilly (dally) I ran through a (alley)\nI bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)\nThis was a girl playing hard to get\nSo I said \"What's wrong?\" cause she looked upset\nShe said um:\nIt's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue\nYou went away, now my life is filled with rainy days\nI love you so, how much you'll never know\nCause you took your dope away from me\n\nDamn, now what was I to do?\nShe's crying over me and she was feelin blue\nI said, \"Um, don't cry, dry your eye\nAnd here comes your mother with those two little guys\"\nHer mean mother steps then says to me \"Hi!\"\nDecked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye\nPunched her in the belly and stepped on her feet\nSlammed the child on the hard concrete\nThe bitch was strong, the kids was gone\nSomething was wrong I said, \"What was goin on?\"\nI tried to break it up, I said, \"Stop it, just leave her!\"\nShe said, \"If I can't smoke none, she can't either!\"\nShe grabbed me closely by my socks\nAnd so I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks\nBut um, they gave chase, they caught up quick\nThey started crying on my shoes and grabbin' my dick\nAnd saying \"Why don't you give me a play\nSo we can break it down the Long Beach way\nAnd if you give me that okay\nI'll give you all my love today\nDoggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see?\nSomehow your words just hypnotize me\nAnd I just love your jazzy ways\nDoggy Dogg, your love is here to stay\"\nAnd on and on and on she kept goin'\nThe bitch been around before my mother's born!\nI said \"Cheer up!\" and I gave her a hit\nI said, \"You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!\"\nShe said, \"No you're not!\" then she starts cryin'\nI says I'm 19, she says, \"Stop lyin!\"\nI says, \"I am, go ask my mother\nAnd with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover\"\n\nYeah, uh, tick-tock ya don\u2019t stop\nAnd to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don\u2019t quit\nYeah, n'ya tick-tock ya don\u2019t stop\nAnd to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don\u2019t quit\nBiatch!23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Talk shit and I'm dumpin'\nI had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'\nDon't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China\nYou'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya\nSo peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through\nOne, two, three: you can't see me\nI'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics\nA fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets\nIt's on again, It's on and poppin'\nAll I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'\nI wanna see some panties droppin'\nI'm coming from L.A, she used to chill with Dre up in Compton\n(All I ever did was just use that ho\nShow her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)\nI\u2019m dishin out blues, I\u2019m upsettin' like bad news\nCut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes\nKurupt, the name\u2019s often marked for catchin' slugs\nAnd I smoke weed for the fuck of it\nRuff and rugged shit, it\u2019s unexplanatory how I gets wicked\nBut it\u2019s mandatory that I kick it\nCheck it, I\u2019m runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it\nHoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'\nPrepare for a war, it\u2019s on, I\u2019m head huntin'\nHit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn\nPeep, the massacre from a verbal assassin\nMurderin' with rhymes packin' TEC-9\u2019s for some action\nYou really don\u2019t know, do you, you fuckin' wit a hog\nYou can\u2019t do me, I\u2019m goin' out looney like O-Dog\nIt's a crazy, mixed-up world\nIt's a Doggy Dogg World\n\nTha Dogg Pound rocks the party (All night long)\nUh-huh, till when?

Aiyo what's up with the crew?\nIs them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?\"\nI said, \"If you ain't up on thangs\nSnoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game\"\nIt's like this they don't understand\nIt's an everyday thang, to gangbang\nMake that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know\nWhat's up witchu? I represent the Pound and Death Row\nAnd can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach\nAnd Compton and Watts see D-O-G's\nNow, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't\nSee long to the G of the gang\nOne gun is all that we need, to put you to rest\n(Pump pump!) Put two slugs dead in your chest\nNow you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping\n6 feet deep in, fucking with the Pound is\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\n\nThe cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue\nNow you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew\nAin't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do\nLeave you in a state of paranoia, oooh\nDon't make a move for your gat so soon\n'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon\nWalk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you\nI'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you\nI won't leave you until you get the full comprehension\nAnd when you do, that's when the mission\nOr survival becomes your every thought\nKeep your eyes open 'cause you don't wanna be caught\nHalf stepping with your weapon on safety\nNow break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me\nTake this 211 to another level\nI come up with your ends, you go down with the Devil\nNow roam through the depths of Hell\nWhere the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nNow tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?\nSerial killa! Serial killa! Serial killa!\n(Wake up in the morning, eat your Lucky Charms cereal)\n\nDeep, deep like the mind of Minolta\nNow picture this\nLet's picnic inside a morgue\nNot pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets!\nAnd I got the machine to crack your fuckin chest plates\nOpen and release them guts\nThen I release def cuts\nBrutal, jagged edged, totally rough-neck!\nNow everybody scream, 'nough respect to the X\n'Nough respect given\nDisrespect and you will not be living\nWord to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma\n\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nNow tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?\nSerial killa!

You gotta have cake to\nYou'll have Sunday's with chiquitas\nYou'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena\nAnd I can take you\nI'm not sure what I see\nCupid don't fuck with me!\nAre you telling me this is a sign?\nShe's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys\nAre you telling me this is a sign?

I fucked all your groupies\nWhen you was doing time in Camp Snoopy\nWith the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches\nAnd you was payin' niggas off with all my riches\nYou so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?\nOh I know (bitch!)\nBut I walk the mainline every time I go down\nYou can check my G Files I do it L.B.C. style\n.. I got the word on you Simon\nYou need to just start rhymin'\nCause you the biggest star on your label\nAnd them other niggas just crumbs off my table\nYou're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop\nAnd I still ain't been paid, for \"1-8-7 on a cop\"\nI started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit\nIf you keep talkin shit on Crip!\nIt all boils down to the fact\nThat you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)\nIt all boils down to the fact\nThat you're jealous of my paper stack (gon' get pimp slapped)\n\nMoney, I get it, paper I got it\nI got the dope\nHeaters, I keep em, bitches I got em\nRun up, ya get done up, I stay one up\n\nIf I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous\nAnd I'll be spending money out the anus\nYour only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level\nMan you worse than them devils\nAlotta niggas should've said it, fuck em\nBut I'ma say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em\nThis nigga's a bitch like his wife\nSuge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life\nAnd I'ma let the whole world see\nCause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me\nWe can go head up, nigga, set it up\nOr we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up\nYour rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up\nCause I'll fuck every last one of 'em up, especially Kurupt (shshshsh)\nSee that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up (what's up)\nHe better keep it Crippin', and slip his clip in\nCause these niggas trippin', this is official business\nDo the same way, leave no witnesses\nThis is that unexpected misdirected, sprayed, covered and protected\nStrip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it\nIt's all to the good again\nYou can catch Snoopy Do Double in the hood again (Eastside)\nSpinning that real times, spitting that real shit\nTo make the whole world feel it (feel it)\nSo put the bacon in the skillet (hahaha), and try to peel it\nCause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga\n\nMoney, I get it, paper I got it\nHeaters, I keep em, bitches I got em\nMoney, I get it, paper I got it\nJealous ass nigga2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

(Nowhere)\nWhere do hungry and the needy-greedies got to eat? (But who cares?)\nLife is so crucial and cold, as for, for the children\nIn this world they hopes and dreams can't unfold\nThe young and old churches, the spiritual dreams, seasonal things\nHeard throughout the ghetto, reaches gangstas and dope fiends, huh\n'Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it\n'Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood, now we ballin'\nLivin' to a new year of better thangs\nCelebrate it with some Champagne, haha, check it (Yeah)\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\n\nNow on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me\nA sack of the Krazy Glue and told me to smoke it up slowly\nNow on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me\nA fifth of Henn-dawg and told me to take my mind off that weed\nNow by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me\nA whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nothin' but game to me\n\nBack then, you woke up to the sound of \"I Saw Mama Kissing Santa\"\nMade you reminisce on the old fashion Christmas days\nGifts, Mr. Fat Man jolly with joy\nDown ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys\nPumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in\nAnd hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall\nRun to the window, put my eyes to the sky\nTo see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy\nI sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine\nMy bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine 'til next year come\nI try to see the same thing, they got us brainwashed dumb\nAnd when you find it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot\n'Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got\nYou got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people\nWell-wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh, don't get too close because you might get shot)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto (Welcome to the ghetto)\n\nSanta Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'\nPinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain\nSeason's greetings, all the proceedings\nAre brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'\nChestnuts roastin' on a open fire\nSingin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle?\nI didn't pout and I ain't even shouted\nI even stayed in the house when the homies tried to sneak me out\nAnd all I want for Christmas is my six-four Chevrolet\nAnd a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly\nAin't that somethin'? (Uh-huh) Nah, ain't that nothin'\nHow it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'\nEverybody happy (Happy), hair still nappy\nGonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy\nCatch me giving out turkeys at the church house\nDon't try to work me, just stand in line and everything gon' be fine\nHolla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down\nAin't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound\nAnd we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs\nChristmas on the Row, can you dig it? (Can you dig it?)\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\n\nChristmas Eve, I believe '76 was the year\nGirls and boys full off joy with the season cheer\nSmell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked\nTo be ate after everything gone off your plate\nBut wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice\nOn the table, are we able to proceed tonight?\nI wonder what the morn bringin' so it's hard to doze off\nThree 'o clock in my socks I crack the door soft\nHopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa\nNow who the hell is this in this blue bandana?\nMessin' with the boxes that's up under the tree\nLook like Santa Claus done crossed into a woman to me\nNow I'm comin' to see the whole picture gettin' clearer\nHow we have less as X-Mas get nearer\nMirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've been deceived\nAnd thank you, Saint Trick, for the gifts I received\nSo I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it\nThis'll be me and mom's private secret\n\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\n\nWe wish you a happy new year\nWe wish you a happy new year\nWe wish you a happy new year\nWe wish you a happy new year\n\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

When I was out there, I didn't understand it either. They couldn't talk peace with me. They tried, and I was like, \"Nigga, that's schoolyard.\" You can't find a home in my generation that put in more work than me. You may find one or two that put in as much as me, but you ain't gon' find none that put in more than me. And I'm here to tell you that shit was worthless, bro. When they try to peace, I don't wanna peace. Look where I'm at. This shit ain't cool, bro. Crazy part of this, you go this way to me, two steps that way, you got 60s. You go two steps this way, you got Bloods. We wait for each when we walk to trial, bro. We united in here. Nigga might not hang with a nigga every day, but we know we got each other's backs. And I don't knock y'all out there that ain't with the peace, but don't get on people that are.

We...we were smashin on niggas, we was fuckin people up. We was..determined to be the hardest, meanest, baddest, coldest, roughest toughest in the game. That was our mission. Uhh..TDE. Rappers. They're peaceful, they love, they get down. They got rappers from everywhere and they represent hip-hop and they don't represent negativity and violence. And tryin to mash and disrespect it. So it's like, that how Death row came.. We came out disrespectin' Eazy E and anyone who had a problem with Dr. Dre.\nThat was our first get down. It was \"fuck dem niggas up first\". That's not TDE mentality. Their mentality is cool with everybody. Kendrick Lamar flipped out on everybody. That's that Death Row influence, that may have cause him to backslide and feel a certain way. Which I support fully and his thoughts in what he said...Cause I'm from the West Coast, fuck errbody who got a problem with it.\nBut I don't feel like TDE and Death Row are the same thing in any way. I feel like Death Row paved the way for TDE...To do it in their own way... So they can stay around 20 years from now.\n\nCan ya dig that?10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
