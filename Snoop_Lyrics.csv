I didn't pout and I ain't even shouted I even stayed in the house when the homies tried to sneak me out And all I want for Christmas is my six-four Chevrolet And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly Ain't that somethin'?  Nah, ain't that nothin' How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin' Everybody happy , hair still nappy Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy Catch me giving out turkeys at the church house Don't try to work me, just stand in line and everything gon' be fine Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs Christmas on the Row, can you dig it?  Santa Claus  Is coming straight to the ghetto  Christmas Eve, I believe '76 was the year Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked To be ate after everything gone off your plate But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice On the table, are we able to proceed tonight? I wonder what the morn bringin' so it's hard to doze off Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the door soft Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana? Messin' with the boxes that's up under the tree Look like Santa Claus done crossed into a woman to me Now I'm comin' to see the whole picture gettin' clearer How we have less as X-Mas get nearer Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've been deceived And thank you, Saint Trick, for the gifts I received So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it This'll be me and mom's private secret  Santa Claus  Is coming straight to the ghetto Santa Claus  Is coming straight to the ghetto  We wish you a happy new year We wish you a happy new year We wish you a happy new year We wish you a happy new year  Santa Claus  Is coming straight to the ghetto Santa Claus  Is coming straight to the ghetto"

On TDE: “They’re Not Death Row”,https://genius.com/Snoop-dogg-on-tde-theyre-not-death-row-annotated,"No, they're not the new Death Row Because TDE did it completely different than Death Row did it. Death Row did it with a gangster approach. We...we were smashin on niggas, we was fuckin people up. We was..determined to be the hardest, meanest, baddest, coldest, roughest toughest in the game. That was our mission. Uhh..TDE. Rappers. They're peaceful, they love, they get down. They got rappers from everywhere and they represent hip-hop and they don't represent negativity and violence. And tryin to mash and disrespect it. So it's like, that how Death row came.. We came out disrespectin' Eazy E and anyone who had a problem with Dr. Dre. That was our first get down. It was ""fuck dem niggas up first"". That's not TDE mentality. Their mentality is cool with everybody. Kendrick Lamar flipped out on everybody. That's that Death Row influence, that may have cause him to backslide and feel a certain way. Which I support fully and his thoughts in what he said...Cause I'm from the West Coast, fuck errbody who got a problem with it. But I don't feel like TDE and Death Row are the same thing in any way. I feel like Death Row paved the way for TDE...To do it in their own way... So they can stay around 20 years from now.  Can ya dig that?"
Midnight Love,https://genius.com/Snoop-dogg-midnight-love-lyrics,"Midnight love Midnight love Midnight love Midnight love  Midnight love Troubles plots on thee mind Midnight love Leave your back door open Midnight love Just have it ready for me Back door little druggie's callin' for you  I'm makin' things happen fast Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along Face lookin' stupid, broke, startin' feelin' dumb I'm young but I'm a grown man Takin' thangs into my own hands, I'm tryin' to own land But life a twist ya like a twister, get twisted with this It seems on but its off, I keep missin' this shit I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide eyed Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink they dip Its hard to hang on, but I can't let go Smokin' on my last breath Blow out life whats left is death Now I can go wrong or I can G or make a right Whatever way that I turn, its still death after life And if it don't discourage me, I ain't got nuthin' to lose But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn But I learn cuz I see, and I earn cuz I G But, these problems probably havin' niggas prayin' to see At an early age so at an early stage in life I chose to get my shit tight, ya gotta struggle and fight It cost an arm and a leg, just to live on your knees And I'm tryin' to keep my sanity, God help me please Midnight love Troubles plots on thee mind Midnight love Leave your back door open Midnight love Just have it ready for me Back door little druggie's callin' for you  Mischievous and devious is how my life was Puttin' the serve down for cabbage, just to keep the cluckers buzzed Some of the money makin' muthafuckaz from the other side Was thinkin' about a jack move, tryin' to whoo-ride Gettin' jealous cuz my niggas got this rap game sold up Them niggas wanna trip,  they got blown up Blown up or not you can still get shot You don't never play a muthafucka out for his knot Rule number one, pay attention to this shit Don't be fuckin' wit my niggas on the midnight shift, Shit  He kept, gettin' it on, to the break of dawn Now he's known, for servin' more than an oz. so He's got a 187 on his muthafuckin' chest A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest He's lookin' for them niggas from the night before 12:01 he layin' low, all in a nigga back do'  Midnight love Troubles plots on thee mind Midnight love Leave your back door open Midnight love Just have it ready for me Back door little druggie's callin for you  Now its all about the dollars, Impalas that bounce Havin' cars and bitches, havin' a proper amount Quarter million chillin' Robbin banks and many mo' Some life and darkness We all get it started, coldhearted Get around, my life won't change for the good It seems soon I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood Daz, would you come and ride for me? Ayo Daz, you da soldier would you die for me? The hood tradition's got a lot of niggas killed for dumb shit The OG's think they run shit, the youngsters control shit Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite Be siding with the drama when the dogg fight, street fight And a lot a mob puttin' on mo Problems get solved, but revolved with ammo and a fo-fo But sure I did the record blast five times 254 sentenced to jail time Midnight love I've been walkin' the street Midnight love I put my life on the line Midnight love Cuz I've just gotta be me Midnight love Midnight love Troubles plots on thee mind Midnight love Leave your back door open Midnight love Just have it ready for me Back door little druggie's callin' for you"
