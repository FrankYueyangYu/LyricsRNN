Castle on the Hill,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-castle-on-the-hill-lyrics,"When I was six years old I broke my leg I was running from my brother and his friends And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down I was younger then, take me back to when I  Found my heart and broke it here Made friends and lost them through the years And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown But I can't wait to go home  I'm on my way Driving at 90 down those country lanes Singing to ""Tiny Dancer"" And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill  Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right But I was younger then, take me back to when  We found weekend jobs, when we got paid We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown But I can't wait to go home I'm on my way Driving at 90 down those country lanes Singing to ""Tiny Dancer"" And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill  One friend left to sell clothes One works down by the coast One had two kids but lives alone One's brother overdosed One's already on his second wife One's just barely getting by But these people raised me And I can't wait to go home  And I'm on my way, I still remember These old country lanes When we did not know the answers And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill"

With this you must know that the numbers just sold Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 percent of it when we wake But the other 10 percent, it never fades Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss And most of these other guys are kids that pose His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow Igh!"

Oh, you and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied You and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied Because, if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh) And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered From all that I've done wrong And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one But I know God made another one of me To love you better than I ever will  'Cause you and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied You and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied"
Best Part of Me,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-best-part-of-me-lyrics,"My lungs are black, my heart is pure My hands are scarred from nights before And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places I am a little insecure My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue I bite my nails and tell the truth I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates My skin is inked, but faded, too  But she loves me, she loves me Why the hell does she love me When she could have anyone else?

Nina,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-nina-lyrics,"I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder? Under the covers where we used to lay And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played I'd be on tour almost every day When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe We used each other's air just for the people to see And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep We go anywhere, our minds would take us And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause We can all be loved the way that God made us And time's the only reason that we could break up Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again  Oh Nina You should go, Nina Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road, Nina But then again you should know, Nina Cause that’s you and me both, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now, now? And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish Back to the burrow with all the Celtics I disappear, you call me selfish I understand but I can’t help it I put my job over everything except my family and friends But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back Overlook the situation Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane But in a day we'll have to say it again  Oh Nina You should go, Nina Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road, Nina But then again you should know, Nina Cause that’s you and me both, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now, now? Love will come and love will go But you can't make it on your own Sing that song, go Oh won't you leave me now? People grow and fall apart But you can't mend your broken heart Take it back, go Oh won't you leave me now?  Oh Nina You should go, Nina (Love will come and Love will go) Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina (But you can make it on your own) Oh, won't you leave me now? (Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now) And I've been living on the road, Nina (People grow and fall apart) But then again you should know, Nina (But you can mend your broken heart) Cause that’s you and me both, Nina (Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now) Oh, won't you leave me now, now? Oh Nina You should go, Nina (Love will come and Love will go) Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina (But you can make it on your own) Oh, won't you leave me now?

Wake Me Up,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-wake-me-up-lyrics,"I should ink my skin with your name And take my passport out again And just replace it See I could do without a tan On my left hand Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle And I should run you a hot bath Fill it up with bubbles 'Cause maybe you're loveable Maybe you're my snowflake And your eyes turn from green to gray And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place And you should never cut your hair 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder  And you will never know Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love When you wake me up  And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me Could you make me a cup of tea To open my eyes in the right way And I know you love Shrek 'Cause we've watched it 12 times And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too And if your DVD breaks today You should've got a VCR Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say I know I've always been shit at computer games And your brother always beats me And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you laugh at me And be asking me If I'm gonna be home next week And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets And you will never know Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love When you wake me up  And I think you hate the smell of smoke You always try and get me to stop But you drink as much as me And I get drunk a lot So I’ll take you to the beach And walk along the sand And I'll make you a heart pendant With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like a necklace So the heart falls where your chest is Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach And it falls just where it needs to be And rests peacefully So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now Against yours now Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"
All of the Stars,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-all-of-the-stars-lyrics,"It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon I saw a shooting star and thought of you I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew If you were here, I'd sing to you You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two I'm miles away from seeing you But I can see the stars from America I wondered, do you see them too?  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  I can hear your heart on the radio beat They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us Back to the time you were lying next to me I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew Everything led back to you So can you see the stars over Amsterdam? You're the song my heart is beating to So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  And oh, I know And oh, I know And oh I can see the stars From America"
The Man,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-the-man-lyrics,"Now I don't wanna hate you Just wish you'd never gone for the man And waited two weeks at least Before you let him take you I stayed true, I kind of knew You liked the dude from private school He's waiting for the time to move I knew he had his eyes on you He's not the right guy for you Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth No, I would never lie to you But it was never fine to lose you And what a way to find out It never came from my mouth You never changed your mind But you were just afraid to mind out But  it I won't be changing the subject, I love it I'll make your little secret public It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons You sleep with in your closet to get back at me Trapped and I'm lacking sleep Fact is you're mad at me Because I backtrack so casually You're practically my family If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be But tragically our love just lost the will to live But would I kill to give it one more shot? I think not I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore  Recently I tend to zone out Up in my headphones to Holocene You promised your body but I'm away so much I stay more celibate than in a monastery I'm not cut out for life on the road 'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much And at the time we'd just go, so sue me I guess I'm not the man that you need Ever since you went to uni I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad But when I broke the industry That's when I broke your heart I was supposed to chart and celebrate But good things are over fast I know it's hard to deal with and see this I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features Then I turn the music off And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus I never really want to believe this Got advice from my dad and he Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need I guess I'm unaware of it Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore  And since you left, I've given up my days off It's what I need to stay strong I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook 'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could The irony is if my career in music didn't exist In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill Go down in history as just a wasted talent Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ? It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this These things happen for a reason and you can't change  Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty But I had to get this off my chest I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore"
Drunk,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-drunk-lyrics,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up On the right side of the wrong bed And never an excuse I made up Tell you the truth I hate What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me So now I'll maybe lean back there I'm sat here, wishing I was sober I know I'll never hold you like I used to  But our house gets cold when you cut the heating Without you to hold I'll be freezing Can't rely on my heart to beat it Cause you take part of it every evening Take words out of my mouth just from breathing Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?' Should I, Should I?  Maybe I'll get drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little love I wanna hold your heart in both hands Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can And I've got no plans for the weekend So should we speak then? Keep it between friends? Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to There may be other people like us Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before You don't hold me anymore  On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name I know I can't heal things with a handshake You know I can't change, as I began saying You cut me wide open like a landscape Open bottles of beer but never champagne To applaud you with the sound that my hands make Should I? Should I?  Maybe I'll get drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little love All by myself I'm here again All by myself You know I'll never change All by myself All by myself  I'm just drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little love"
Runaway,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-runaway-lyrics,"I've known it for a long time Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine Disappearing all night I don't wanna know where he's been lying I know what I wanna do Wanna runaway, runaway with you Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go  ""How long you leaving?"" Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but  I love him from my skin to my bones But I don't wanna live in his home There's nothing to say 'cause he knows I'll just runaway and be on my own  I've never seen my dad cry Cold as stone in the kitchen light I'll tell you it's about time But I was raised to keep quiet This is what I'm gonna do Gonna runaway, gonna make that move Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go ""How long you leaving?"" Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but  I love him from my skin to my bones But I don't wanna live in his home There's nothing to say 'cause he knows I'll just runaway and be on my own  Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back As I packed my clothes up My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack Intends to show love I don’t wanna live this way Gonna take my things and go If things change in a matter of days I could be persuaded to hold on Mama was the same None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that I don't wanna runaway And one of these days, I might just show that Put my home in a suitcase Tie both shoe laces, and hope that Things change, but for now I'll leave town With a backpack on my shoulder I love him from my skin to my bones But I don't wanna live in his home There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows I'll just runaway and be on my own"

Little Lady,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-little-lady-lyrics,"Listen, little lady This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try And you remember that your punter went crazy last night You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in  She's just under the upper hand And goes mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland And sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly For angels to fly Little lady, your mind you've made up Your injuries you can't hide with make-up You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip Last year when your pimp just lost it He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 'Cause all the heroin is making you age But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram Mother had to get you out the motherland to study That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand Little does she know you're never coming back She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn  She's just under the upper hand And goes mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland And sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly Now an angel will die, covered in white With closed eyes and hoping for a better life This time now, we'll fade out tonight Straight down the line  Little lady, you're trembling with fear Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?"" He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore You're having a conversation you could be murdered for You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court He's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid 'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat And then a voice says, ""Where you been, bitch? I wanna know"" No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness You open the front door, he boots you in There's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight At this point, your life flashes before your eyes Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street Little lady left this earth in the worst way All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday And we're all under the upper hand And going mad for a couple grams And we don't wanna go outside, tonight 'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland And sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly For angels to fly And fly, fly For angels to fly To fly, to fly And angels to die"

No Name (The Bastard Executioner Theme Song),https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-no-name-the-bastard-executioner-theme-song-lyrics,"Born with a heart That could ache more than beat The mind of the killer The soul of the meek Born aimless and angry Ran hard from the day Left love at the crossroad Into a man that I hate  Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire? Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars? Should I drop to my knees? Scream your name out in vain? Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?  King of the kings, do you feel any pain?  I fight for the hope That blood has a face To give me a kiss For the faith that I wait Flock with no shepherd Is a vulnerable game I can live without heart, without love But I do need a name Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire? Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars? Should I drop to my knees? Scream your name out in vain? Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?  King of the kings, do you feel any pain? King of the kings, do you feel any pain? King of the kings, do you feel any pain?"

I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two  The pavement is my friend It will take me where I need to go I find it trips me up And puts me down This is not what I'm used to The shop across the road Fulfills my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls I don't think I'm gonna make it Past tomorrow London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home (Woo!)  I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two  And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled With the sound of the city life echoed in my head Do I need this to keep me alive? The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along  London calls me a stranger This is not my home, home  I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two"

Lately,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-lately-lyrics,"I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine Cause real recognise real is what my father says And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close  5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed? It's D-E-V to the Zed Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying Cause I got too much to stay awake for To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in lately  I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die) Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move We scan the situation, analyse information And then decide what probably is most practical to do Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"" What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"" In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got I keep my pupils engaged Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake  I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in lately I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in lately"
